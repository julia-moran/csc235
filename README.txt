In this project, you will be introduced to writing a 32-bit, x86 assembly language (MASM)
program. For each integer from 1 to 20, you will compute the cumulative sum of all integers up
to and including that integer and store the value in memory. You will then compute the square
of each of the first 20 positive integers, subtract the stored sum for that integer, and output the
difference.
