Assignment Instructions:

This assignment serves as a hands-on introduction to basic, combinatorial, logic circuit design
using circuit components available in Logisim. The task is relatively simple. Create a circuit that
will divide one unsigned 8-bit value by another and, optionally, round the result to the nearest
integer value.
