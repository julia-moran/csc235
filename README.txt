Computer Organizaton and Assembly Language, Dr. Carelli, Fall 2022

This repository contains projects created for Computer Organization and Assembly Language, a class required for my major that I took in the Fall 2022
semester. This course focused on assembly language, logic circuits, as well as the internal organization of computers. Projects 2, 4, and the final project are 32-bit and coded in Microsoft Macro Assembler. Projects 1 and 3 are projects that created digital logic circuits in Logism.
