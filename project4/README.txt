Assignment Instructions:

In this project, you will be introduced to the concept of writing procedures in MASM. The task is to loop through
a list of characters supplied by the user and test for the existence of each of those characters in a string, which
has also supplied by the user. Matching characters should be stored and then output once the search has been completed
for all characters. First, the user is prompted for a target string. Next, he/she is prompted for a list of characters.
The search is then conducted and the resulting output is a list of all characters found in the targeted string.
